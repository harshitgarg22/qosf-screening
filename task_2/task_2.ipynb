    "Now, as per the problem statement, we have been asked to only determine parameters through a ML technique such as gradient descent. So our problem essentially boils down to using gradient descent to update the two parameters such that the value of $(\\theta_1, \\theta_2)$ approaches $(\\pi, -\\pi/2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For doing that, we will need to define a cost function. Now this cost function will naturally be dependent on the counts of $01$ and $10$ measurements. Specifically, the difference of the two must be minimized, whereas the counts of residual states $00$ and $11$ must be penalized.\n",
